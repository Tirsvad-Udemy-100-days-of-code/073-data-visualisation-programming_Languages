## Checklist Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A concrete deliverable is defined for every gate | Pass | Deliverable section names concrete files and functions. |
| 2 | Explicit Go/No-Go criteria are stated for each gate | Pass | Go / No-Go table has checkable criteria. |
| 3 | Dependencies on other milestones are explicitly mapped | Pass | Dependencies section present. |
| 4 | Each milestone is traceable to a Business Case objective or KPI | Pass | Traceability cites BC-001 objectives and success criteria. |
| 5 | Milestone owner and approving reviewer are identified | Pass | Owner S01; approving reviewer S01 as stand-in. |
| 6 | Milestone has a defined target date consistent with project constraints | Pass | Target date inside the BC-001 constraint (finish by 2026-11-14). |

## Language and Domain Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Metadata table has a `Language` row and a `Domain` row, and neither is a placeholder | Pass | Metadata has `Language` = en and `Domain` = it. |
| 2 | `Language` is a BCP 47 code and `Domain` is a value from the registry's domain list | Pass | `en` is a BCP 47 code; `it` is in the registry domain list. |
| 3 | The content (prose and table cells) is written in the stated language | Pass | All prose and table cells are English. |
| 4 | The register matches the one the registry gives for the artifact type | Pass | Register of the artifact type as the registry gives it (executive English for BC, MIL, PP; professional English for SA). |
| 5 | Domain terms are the PO terms of the domain's dictionary, with no synonyms | Pass | Terms (tag, DataFrame, pivot, rolling mean) are used with one word each. The project has no DICT, so there is no dictionary list to deviate from. |
| 6 | Metadata keys, section headings, IDs and statuses are in English | Pass | Keys, headings, IDs and statuses are English. |
| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | No `<name>.<language>.md` twin exists. |
| 8 | A change of language or domain since the previous accepted version has a Version History row and was reviewed again | Pass | First version; no change of language or domain. |
| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | S01 reads English and knows the IT domain; the AI acts as stand-in, not independent (Mode below). |
| 10 | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language | Pass | Abbreviations spelled out on first use (BC, SA, PO, MIL in their headings and tables). |

## Overall Verdict

Go. Every Mandatory criterion passes. The review is a stand-in review: the author and the reviewer are the same person's workflow, so it is not independent and stays open to challenge in the run summary.
